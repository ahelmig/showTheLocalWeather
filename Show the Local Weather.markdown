Show the Local Weather
----------------------
This is my take on the Local Weather App project that I created while doing Free Code Camp using the OpenWeatherMap API.  

Lesson learned: geolocation only works in Chrome and Safari via https and jsonp doesn't work when making a call from https to http. 

Any constructive feedback would be appreciated! Enjoy!
